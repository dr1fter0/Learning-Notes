# Terms and Understanding:
Vulnerability~ 
	A vulnerability is a point at which there is potential for a security breach.

Threat~ 
	A threat is some danger that can exploit a vulnerability.

Countermeasure~ 
	A countermeasure is an action you to take to protect your information against 	the threats and vulnerabilities.

Virus~ 
	A virus inserts a copy of itself into applications or crucial parts of the 	operating system in order to infect a computer or other targets that 	communicate with that computer.

Worm~ 
	A worm exploits the vulnerabilty of computing devices in a network and 	replicates itself by finding other vulnerable devices.
Trojan~ 
	Malware disguised as something useful and can be self replicating. 

Ransomeware~ 
	Malware that demands a payment in order to unlock the encrypted files or 	deleting them or misusign your device.

Spyware~ 
	Records the activities of the user such as passwords and is transmitted to the 	user who deployed it. A typical example is a keylogger.

Botnets~ 
	Malware that allows the attacker to control a group of computers and use them 	to gather information or launch attacks such as DDos attacks.

Daemon~
	A service that runs in Linux.

Plaintext> 
	Information that can be read by humans or a machine.
Ciphertext> 
	Is encrypted data.  A cypher is the mathematics or algorithm responsibile for turing plaintext 	into ciphertext.
Encryption> 
	Is the process of converting plaintext to ciphertext.
Decryption> 
	Is the opposite.

The difference between asymmetric cryptography vs symmetric cryptography.
Asymmetric is known as public key encryption where each user creates their own encryption keys. They have a private key which is kept safe and never distributed. The public key can be sent to anyone whom they want to exchange the encrypted information with.
The public key is the only key that decrypt ciphertext using the corresponding private key and vice versa. Even if one key is discovered or captured, the private keys value cannot be determined.





Firewalls.
> A firewall is software blocks dangerous communications from spreading across a network from either the outside world into a local network or from oen part of the local network to another.

> An intrusion detection system (IDS) may be a dedicated device or software which can be split into two types:
> A Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) which is responsible for monitoring data passing over a network.
> A Host intrusion detection system (HIDS) which is responsible for monitoring data to and from a computer.

> A IDS can support a network firewall, ideally the firewall should be closed to all traffic apart from that which is known to be needed such as web traffic or email. An IDS can be used to scan any traffic passing through the firewall for potential attacks using a NIDS. As well as this, it can detect those coming from within the network such as infected computer using HIDS.

> Intrusion can be both passive and reactive. If passive, it will alert the administrator, allowing them to take appropraite action however it can also be reactive and try and stop the intrusion from happening whilst informing the administrator. It would do this by blocking data packets being sent from the IP source. 

Torrenting
> Torrenting is simply 'files' that hold information related to other files and folders that are distributed. 
When you donwload a move torrent, this "torrent file" contans necessary information which will let you get that movie.

When you start downloading the fies associated with that torrent, you might see a file tht is not familar with those other chunks of data, these are used to verify the files. 
Torrenting is pretty much P2P downloading, they are downloaded in small bits to your system and are verfiyed upon download.

A torrent client is needed to download larger files and the different bits come from different computers still using a P2P network.

Torrenting Key Terms
> Seed- A person that has the complete file, all the bits is called a seeder. This person has all the chunks in one place and the file swarm can grw like a tree, from this one seed.
> Peer- Peers are people who do not have the complete files but bits and peices of them instead.
> Leech- Leechers are individuals that download the files without seeding the files. They have a higher download compared to upload, as a result they are seen as a leecher of the torrenting network. They do not contribue back.

> Due to how torrenting works, it means you can pretty much download anything and whilst this could be considered illegal due to copyright issues. Probably better to use a VPN when torrenting.
