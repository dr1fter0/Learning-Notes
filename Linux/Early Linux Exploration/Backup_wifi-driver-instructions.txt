How to search the forum

Before posting a new thread, try searching the forum to see if your question has already been asked.

Searching is easy - click on the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner, and type one or more keywords. Threads and posts containing that keyword will then be shown.

For example, if you’re posting about a Dell XPS 15 9560, try searching for “Dell 9560” or “XPS 9560”. It’s very likely that the issues you’re having will already be under discussion!

If looking for something very specific, you could also try a search engine and add the site to the search options, e.g. site:forum.manjaro.org <search_term>.

Hello everyone,
I recently bought a usb wifi adapter for my manjaro desktop. The adapter works on windows, so we know that the adapter by itself does work. I tried to follow this really nice guide by @tbg

    Realtek WiFi driver installation guide: Intoduction Driver pre-install preparation Installing drivers from the AUR WiFi driver troubleshooting Tips Opening a help request thread Removing a sub-optimal driver Introduction: This tutorial will guide you through installing your Realtek WiFi driver from the AUR. You should be aware that there are potential risks from installing software from the AUR. Users new to Manjaro should become familiar with the AUR (and its associated risks) before … 

However, I still couldn't manage to get it to work. One thing I am not certain of is the adapter model. On the driver installation disc (which has linux drivers too and they fail to install ) it has 2 sets of linux drivers. One for RTL8811CU and the other for RTL8812BU. I figured the 8812 driver from the aur could work (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rtl8812au-dkms-git). So I followed the above guide but to no avail.
I shall now attach lotd of different outputs which could help some of you experts help me :slight_smile:
So here we go:

Your help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Uninstall any Realtek WiFi driver that you have installed previously.

Then, install either of these drivers from the AUR for the rtl8822bu adapter:

rtl88x2bu-dkms-git

Or:

rtl8822bu-dkms-git

I would advise installing kernel 4.19 for this adapter (test newer kernels once you have things working):

sudo mhwd-kernel -i linux419

Then reboot into kernel 4.19.

You can switch kernels at the grub boot screen when you reboot. If you do not see the grub prompt screen, repeatedly press the ESC, SHIFT or F8 key. This should show the GRUB boot menu if it doesn't appear automatically. As soon as you see the grub boot screen, press the down arrow. Select the "advanced" menu from the choices and press enter. In the next menu you can select the different kernels you have installed to boot from. Select the regular kernel you wish boot into (not the fallback), and then press enter to complete the kernel change.

The following command will install the linux-headers automatically for all installed kernels:

sudo pacman -S $(pacman -Qsq "^linux" | grep "^linux[0-9]*[-rt]*$" | awk '{print $1"-headers"}' ORS=' ')

Ensure the required dependencies are installed:

sudo pacman -S bc dkms git base-devel --needed

If you do not already have an AUR helper enabled on your system then install pamac-cli.

sudo pacman -S pamac-cli

Run either one of the following commands to install the rtl8822bu driver from the AUR:

pamac build rtl88x2bu-dkms-git

Or:

pamac build rtl8822bu-dkms-git

Once the driver installation is complete reboot.

If the driver you installed first does not work, then test alternate drivers from the AUR and alternate kernels until you find a working combination.

It is always a good idea to read recent comments on the driver's AUR homepage in case any new issues have arisen with the driver's installation.

See

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rtl88x2bu-dkms-git/

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rtl8822bu-dkms-git/

More Realtek driver installation tips can be found here:

Realtek driver installation guide

Chip identification for different rtl8812bu adapter versions can be found here:

https://deviwiki.com/wiki/Realtek_RTL8812BU_USB_Module 1

Disabling MAC address randomization is often required for the rtl8812bu adapter to connect properly.

You can disable MAC Address Randomization in Network Manager with the following command:

echo -e "[device]\nwifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no" | sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/disable-random-mac.conf

After creating the new conf file, reboot both your router and your computer.

But I am not sure if it is the 8822bu adapter that I have. Luckily, I have a windows machine that I can check the adapter model on.
Yeah I will shift to the 4.19 to test it out.
Do you think MAC Randomisation affects hwinfo detection? hwinfo should at least detect the device right?
I shall follow your advice and get back to you. Thank you :smiley:

Yes it says 8812bu.
Same as on
https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/WLAN/Karten/Realtek/
In the AUR I also see a driver for 88x2bu, do you think this is more suitable or should i go ahead with 8822bu?

Do whatever you feel like it's your system.

You can always reinstall, but installing multiple drivers (especially from source @ github) often leads to a big mess for newbies.

Yes just wanted your advice, that's all. I will of course install only 1 driver at a time. I'll try both and report back here.

I tried both, 8822bu didn't work but 88x2bu did. Followed your tutorial. Great guide thanks. Marked your answer as solution.

Yes, I don't know if it's a different revision of the adapter responsible some people find the 88x2bu works better for them. There are other drivers for the rtl8812bu in the AUR as well. I will modify my post to include both AUR drivers.

I'm glad the short guide worked for you. Disabling MAC address randomization is often required for this adapter to connect properly (so I included that). It's sometimes very finicky that way.

Glad things worked out.

Uninstall any Realtek WiFi driver that you have installed previously.

Then, install either of these drivers from the AUR for the rtl8822bu adapter:

rtl88x2bu-dkms-git

Or:

rtl8822bu-dkms-git

I would advise installing kernel 4.19 for this adapter (test newer kernels once you have things working):

sudo mhwd-kernel -i linux419

Then reboot into kernel 4.19.

You can switch kernels at the grub boot screen when you reboot. If you do not see the grub prompt screen, repeatedly press the ESC, SHIFT or F8 key. This should show the GRUB boot menu if it doesn't appear automatically. As soon as you see the grub boot screen, press the down arrow. Select the "advanced" menu from the choices and press enter. In the next menu you can select the different kernels you have installed to boot from. Select the regular kernel you wish boot into (not the fallback), and then press enter to complete the kernel change.

The following command will install the linux-headers automatically for all installed kernels:

sudo pacman -S $(pacman -Qsq "^linux" | grep "^linux[0-9]*[-rt]*$" | awk '{print $1"-headers"}' ORS=' ')

Ensure the required dependencies are installed:

sudo pacman -S bc dkms git base-devel --needed

If you do not already have an AUR helper enabled on your system then install pamac-cli.

sudo pacman -S pamac-cli

Run either one of the following commands to install the rtl8822bu driver from the AUR:

pamac build rtl88x2bu-dkms-git

Or:

pamac build rtl8822bu-dkms-git

Once the driver installation is complete reboot.

If the driver you installed first does not work, then test alternate drivers from the AUR and alternate kernels until you find a working combination.

It is always a good idea to read recent comments on the driver's AUR homepage in case any new issues have arisen with the driver's installation.

Disabling MAC address randomization is often required for the rtl8812bu adapter to connect properly.

You can disable MAC Address Randomization in Network Manager with the following command:

echo -e "[device]\nwifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no" | sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/disable-random-mac.conf

After creating the new conf file, reboot both your router and your computer.
